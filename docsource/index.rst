A rapidly growing field in biomedical engineering is point-of-care devices and medical internet-of-things (IoT). Many of these devices can be better utilised by making them remotely viewable (and controllable if appropriate), allowing them to be used outside of a clinical setting and still be monitored by a clinician. However currently no open-source and easily deployable cloud informatic system for medical IoTs is available. To address this need, we have developed an easily deployable, yet scalable, cloud system for hardware-focused medical IoT research groups so that they can test their sensors in a cloud-based system.
